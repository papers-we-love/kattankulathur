### Read research papers from Industry and Academia, every Friday!
PWL KTR is a community of engineers, hackers, researchers, and students who're interested in scientific research from computer science and related fields. In each session, we have one-two paper presentations of 30-60 minutes each. We pick a paper and a speaker prior to the meetup. The speaker walks us through the background, presents the paper, shows a coding demo if possible, All this is followed by a group discussion about the research.

**Time**: 5:30 PM - 6:30PM
